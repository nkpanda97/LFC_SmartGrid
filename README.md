# LFC_SmartGrid
This project is the implementation of a multi area load frequency control of a electrical network 
implemented using model based control. The control strategy is designed in MATLAB and tested on a simulink model.

To run the simulation:

step1: Unzip the folder into your laptop
step2: Open MATLAB with the folder location in its path
step3: Open the file 'FinalScriptControlBasedModelProject.m'
step4: Run the file
Once you run the file, it will also open Simulink and display the final plots.
The 'FileName.p' files are the functions for the actual plant.
